<h1>Football Score Keeper App</h1>

===================

This is a project after Lesson 2A and 2B. It is an app for keeping the score of football matches.

First there is a progress bar:

After 3 seconds the progress bar will be hiden and you have to choose the names of the teams:

After you press the "Football buttton" the game will "start":

By pressing green buttons for goals, yellow or red card or corners, you will add a new value for the current team:

Well, that's my app. If you like it or not, please comment. Give suggestions and so on.
